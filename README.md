Is a card bearing information on both sides, which is intended to be used as an aid in memorization. Each flashcard
bears a question on one side and an answer on the other. Flashcards are often used to memorize vocabulary, historical
dates, formulas or any subject matter that can be learned via a question-and-answer format.
